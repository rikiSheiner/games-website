# About the project
This project is my second project in the course Full Stack. 
The project is implemntation of games website, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
I implemented the games: tic-tac-toe, fluppy-bird, whack-a-mole and sanke. 
Each player has his private zone in the web, and can view his achievments for each game and also the achievments of other players. 
I used local storage to save the data.
